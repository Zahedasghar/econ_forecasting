    "text": "Course overview and learning outcomes\nResearch in economics, business and finance requires extensive use of sophisticated and refined quantitative skills. In this course you will be introduced to the models and econometric issues that occur when dealing with time series data. Applications of time series methods to economics and finance will be stressed. Students completing this class will be able to decompose time series into its constituent parts, apply the relevant econometric model to data, be able to understand and deal with underlying dynamic macroeconometric models and be able to estimate and interpret univariate and multivariate time series econometric models. Students will also be able to use estimated time series models for policy analysis and forecasting. Students will acquire competence in the tools and methods used in modern econometric research with a focus on theoretical knowledge, critical reasoning, problem solving, interpretation and evaluation. X-12 ARIMA and seasonal adjustment of macroeconomic series will also be learnt.",
